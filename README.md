# First of all:
This is my first time trying to make my own mod, there've being much troubles I met, but thanks to all my friends and other nice people from the community who are willing to offer help, I could finally make it out.

Now I've managed to include all the "love interest" characters and some other named NPCs in my mod, more are on the way :D.

Not sure how long could go, I will try my best.
If you find any bugs, please give me feedback about them.

Enjoy your play!

# What is the mod for?

1. Display NPC's face on sidebar, facial emotion varies from their ATTITUDE (lust, love, etc.).

2. Facial emotion changes during combat according to their STATUS (health, trust, etc.).

3. Some of the NPC change their appearance after certain events, this also make difference on how they looks in sidebar.

4. For NPC who have random hair colour in different game turn, show their real hair colour in sidebar sprites (as I'm still working on it, this only works on Robin and Kylar for now).
