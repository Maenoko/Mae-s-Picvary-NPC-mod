This is my first time trying to make my own mod, there've being much troubles I met, but thanks to all my friends and other nice people from the community who are willing to offer help, I could finally make it out.

In current stage there are only some "love interest" characters in my mod, but other characters with name are on my list too (maybe more in the future ;D).

Not sure how long could go, I will try my best.
If you find any bugs, please give me feedback about them.

Enjoy your play!
